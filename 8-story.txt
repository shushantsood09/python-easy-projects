Once upon a time, there was a <adjective> zoo. One day, I decided to visit the zoo with my <family member>. We packed our <noun> and headed out early in the <time of day>. The first animal we saw was a <adjective> <animal>. It was so <adjective> that we couldn't stop <verb ending in 'ing'>.

Next, we visited the <place in the zoo>, where we saw <number> <plural noun> jumping around and eating <food>. They seemed to be having so much fun! My favorite part of the zoo was the <color> <animal>. It made a <sound> sound and looked so <adjective>.

Before leaving, we stopped by the zooâ€™s gift shop and bought a <noun> that was shaped like a <animal>. It was truly a <adjective> day at the zoo, and I can't wait to go back!
